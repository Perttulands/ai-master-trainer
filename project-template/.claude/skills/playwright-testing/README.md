# Playwright Testing Skill

This skill is a repo-local guide for writing Playwright E2E tests that catch **integration bugs**:

- hardcoded defaults vs env/store configuration
- divergent code paths ("split-brain")
- persisted-state bleed (localStorage/sql.js)
- mocks masking production failures

Start with:

- `SKILL.md` for principles + coverage checklist
- `patterns.md` for copy/paste snippets
